## Description

This repository contains the training routines and the experiments presented in the paper Graph Neural Networks for the prediction of infinite dilution activity coefficients.

The .bib entry and the link to the paper will be inlcuded once it gets published.

### GNN_IAC

The folder `GNN_whole_dataset` containes the training routines and trained GNNs on the complete dataset consisting of 2810 different binary systems. Reports for the prediction performance are also included along with the predictions themselves. 

### Hybrid models

The GNNs trained on the corresponding feasible data are contained in each of the `0#_Name_of_model` folders. There, you can also find the GNNs trained on the corresponding residuals. The training routines are also included. For each case, a report with the prediction statistics is also given.
